### GENERAL INFORMATION
♥ Even though im introverted PLEASE feel free to talk to me !! I use pony town to make friends so dont be afraid

♥ Taking inspo from me is fine HEAVY inspo is a no. So with copying my skins ( burn )  

♥ I am usually at the danganronpa, mouthwashing, sonic or jjk area


--
**BFYI**

♥ I use jokes like "kys" or "kms," but they’re never meant to be taken seriously. My humor can be a bit suggestive at times, but I know how to filter myself depending on who I’m talking to

♥ I'm often off-tab or AFK, so if I don’t respond, I’m not ignoring you I probably just didn’t see your message. Please whisper me instead

--

**INTERACT**

♥ Anyone can interact but if you want to make the conversation less awkward we could talk about my interest. I have a lot and it'd be a hassle to list them all down so here are the ones i LOVE right now.

Alien stage, mouthwashing, black phone, sonic the hedgechog, epic the musical, identity v, danganronpa, yttd, Jujutsu kaisen, creepypasta, sally face, demon slayer, supernatural (getting into it), mystic messenger, spider verse, ace attorney


**PONY TOWN YES'S AND NO'S**

**YES**

♥ Cuddle + hugs

♥ Interacting

♥ Shipping! I am a multishipper so shipping is fine unless problematic


**NO**

♥ Covering me on purpose

♥ Being apart of the basic dni criteria (Homophobes, transphobes, basic stuff like that.)
