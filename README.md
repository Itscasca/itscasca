### PONY TOWN INFORMATION
--
**BFYI**

♥ Even though I’m introverted, PLEASE feel free to talk to me! Just a heads-up I might come off a little awkward at first

♥ 13+ When **Befriending** Me. If you are below that age small interactions are fine but if you want to genuinelly get to know me be that age or above

♥ I use jokes like "kys" or "kms," but they’re never meant to be taken seriously. My humor can be a bit suggestive at times, but I know how to filter myself depending on who I’m talking to

♥ I'm often off-tab or AFK, so if I don’t respond, I’m not ignoring you I probably just didn’t see your message. Please whisper me instead

**INTERACT**

♥ Anyone can interact but if you want to make the conversation less awkward we could talk about my interest. I have a lot and it'd be a hassle to list them all down so here are the ones i LOVE right now.

Alien stage, mouthwashing, black phone, sonic the hedgechog, epic the musical, identity v, danganronpa, yttd, Jujutsu kaisen, creepypasta, sally face, demon slayer, supernatural (getting into it), mystic messenger, spider verse, ace attorney


**PONY TOWN YES'S AND NO'S**

**YES**

♥ Cuddle + hugs

♥ Interacting

♥ Shipping! I am a multishipper so shipping is fine unless problematic


**NO**

♥ Covering me on purpose

♥ Being apart of the basic dni criteria (Homophobes, transphobes, basic stuff like that.)
